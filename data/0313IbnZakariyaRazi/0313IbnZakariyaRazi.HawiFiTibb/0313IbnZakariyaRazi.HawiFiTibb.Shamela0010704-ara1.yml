90#VERS#COMMENT##: In Vol 7, pages 27 -322 are missing, but these pages could not be considered a missing part. Since all of these pages just include tables and the typist has intentionally left them out since they could not be typed in a simple text file. There are a few other pages that are really missing: PageV02P150-51; PageV04P034-35; PageV04P051-55; PageV04P465; PageV07P27-30. In addition, a part of PageV02P149 is copied into the PageV02P144. A part of PageV04P463 is inserted into PageV04P464, and in PageV04P353, there is a redundant part at the end of the page. Besides, in all pages that I checked, there were a few missing words or typos and this includes even the titles in some cases (in both Shamela and JK texts). A redundant word (“ألف”) also appears in many places. The text is clearly typed carelessly. 2- In some volumes, the text has some extra fourth- level-headers which are very occasional and don’t cover the whole subjects; nevertheless, I tried to keep them, since they are useful and help the reader understand the text. I put an asterisk after these extra fourth-level headers (i.e: ### |||| *) so that they can be easily deleted if they are not necessary (these tags include all fourth-level headers in Vol 2 and 3 and a few fourth-level headers in Vol 4 and 5).
