90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I think it’s better to keep the categorization of
    the book and tag all the headers as second-level header. I tried to make
    the categorization more precise by dividing the book according to the
    names of the Caliphs and the major events; but I couldn’t (except a part
    at the end of the last volume), since the succession of the subjects is
    not clear. In most cases, the beginning and the end of the events are
    not distinguishable and sometimes irrelevant issues appear in the
    process of events. 2- Some English characters appear in the text (for
    example: in Vol 1: pages 6, 7, 8, 25, 26, 30, 48, 54, 105, 152, 182,
    186, 228, 230, …).
