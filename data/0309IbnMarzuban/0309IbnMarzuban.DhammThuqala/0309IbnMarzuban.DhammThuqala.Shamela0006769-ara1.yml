90#VERS#COMMENT##: There are two links in VERS#LINKS. The first one (a link to a payment-based website) is exactly the edition which is used in in Editpro versions. I checked this text. Although it is an HTML file (I couldn’t find the PDF of this edition), it shows that there is no title in this very short text (and nothing else that need to be tagged). I also collated the text with the second link in the VERS#LINKS which is a PDF of a different edition of the text. This edition has no title either. So, as far as structural annotating is concerned, there is nothing in this text that needs to be tagged.
