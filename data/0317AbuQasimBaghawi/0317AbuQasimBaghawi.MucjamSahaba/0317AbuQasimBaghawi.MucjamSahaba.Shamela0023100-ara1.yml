90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- First –level headers = volumes (5 volumes); second-level headers = book sections (25 sections); third-level headers = alphabet letters; fourth-level headers = specific names under each alphabet letter. The “book sections” are actually useless as they signify nothing in the text. They can be omitted; however I kept them since they are part of the text division anyway. 2- The typist has intentionally left out the “سماعات” parts (for example, PageV05P336- 443 or PageV05P436-440).
