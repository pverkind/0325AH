90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- About the titles: There are two titles in “0303Nasai.TasmiyaManLamYarwi” folder. The first is “تسمية من لم يرو عنه غير رجل واحد” and the second is “مجموعة رسائل في علوم الحديث”. After spending a lot of time, I realized that there isn’t any book under the first title (“تسمية من”). This text actually consists of seven very short treatises and “تسمية من لم يرو عنه غير رجل واحد” is just the name of the first treatise. And the funny thing is that all these seven treatises are appendixes to a different book by the same author (i.e “النسائي”) entitled “الضعفاء والمتروکین” which is published together with Bukhari’s “الضعفاء الصغیر” by “دار الوعي” in Aleppo (first edition in 1396, and not 1369 as written in the Metadata). So, such a book under the name “تسمية من لم يرو عنه غير رجل واحد” doesn’t exist. All the four files on the repository under this title consist of these seven treatises. There are also three other files in “0303Nasai.TasmiyaManLamYarwi” folder whose titles are “مجموعة رسائل في علوم الحديث” which, again, consist of the same seven treatises! The editor has collected all the treatises under this title, which is the correct title for such a book. So, we just have one book here. 2- About collating: The first text doesn’t exist and I couldn’t find the second one “مجموعة رسائل في علوم الحديث”. I found another edition under the name “ثلاث رسائل حدیثیّة” by a different publisher (the first link on VERS#LINKS) which consists of three major treatises of these seven treatises. I used this edition for collating (it had a better structure for tagging) and for collating the other four treatises, I used the appendixes to “الضعفاء والمتروكون” (the second link on VERS#LINKS). The only missing parts in this text that need to be added are the titles of four of the seven treatises and a few lines at the end of the fifth treatise (“أحسن الأسانيد التي تروى عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم”).
