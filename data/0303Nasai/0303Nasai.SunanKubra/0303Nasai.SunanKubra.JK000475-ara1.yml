90#VERS#COMMENT##: The editor calls this work al-Sunan al-Kubrā
    because it is based on a number of manuscripts that contain sections
    not present in Kitāb al-Mujtabā / al-Sunan al-Ṣughrā
    (for a list, see the introduction pp. 5-6).

    The edition is based on a number of manuscripts (list: pp. 12-)
    containing different riwāyas of al-Nasā'ī's al-Sunan al-Kubrā, 
    which not always agree on the order of the chapters 
    (see, for example, vol. 3 p. 143 and p. 258):
    * J = Medina, al-Jāmiʿ al-Islāmiyya (riwāya of Ibn al-Aḥmar)
    * T = Tetouan (riwāya of Ibn al-Aḥmar)
    * Ḥ = "al-nuskha al-Turkiyya": Istanbul, Maktabat Murād Bukhārī no. 72 ʿumūmī
      (the source of the Tetouan ms.; combined riwāya of Ibn al-Aḥmar and Ibn al-Siyār)
    * Z/Ṣ = Cairo, Maktabat al-Azhar, no. 1963 (close to the Tetouan ms. => riwāya of Ibn al-Aḥmar?)
    * Ġ = "al-nuskha al-Maghribiyya": Rabāṭ, al-Khizāna al-Malikiyya no. 5952
    * B = Rabāṭ, al-Khizāna al-Malikiyya no. 9067
    * Ẓ = Damascus, al-Maktaba al-Ẓāhiriyya no. 228 (riwāya of Ibn Ḥayyawayh)
    In addition, the editor used al-Nasā'ī's Kitāb al-Mujtabā and al-Mizzī's Aṭrāf
    as sources for his edition, and sometimes adds entire sections from these.

    This editor numbers the aḥādīth mentioned by al-Nasā'ī.
    The digitized version also contains a second set of numbers, 
    in the margin after every paragraph, between two backspaces, 
    which are not in the printed edition; PV has not removed them
    because they may be useful to someone.
    (but it is easy enough to do so: replace "\\ \d+ \\" with "").
    If paragraphs cross page boundaries, the page number of the start 
    of the paragraph is sometimes (but not always) found at the end of the paragraph.
    
    PV added the paratext at the beginning of the Sunan 
    from the Shia001964Vols digitization of the same edition. 

    The two main manuscripts (J and Ġ) end with the Kitāb ʿamal al-yawm wa-al-layla 
    (no. 81 in his counting). They miss nos. 82 (Tafsīr) and 83 (al-Īmān), 
    the former of which is present in the riwāya of Ibn Ḥayyawayh (see vol. 6 p. 282 fn. 1),
    and the latter is absent in all mss. and was added by the editor 
    from al-Sunan al-Ṣughrā (see vol. 6 p. 539 fn. 1). 
    PV has kept the former in the digitized text for now, but they may have to be removed;
    he marked the latter as editorial section (### |EDITOR|).

    The edition contains a number of sections and books that are not in al-Sunan al-Kubrā, 
    and of which the editor states that he added it from [al-Sunan] al-ṣughrā, 
    "for completeness". PV has marked these books as an editorial section (### |EDITOR|).
    * vol. 3 p. 259
    * vol. 3 pp. 336-337
    * vol. 4 pp. 249-250
    * Kitāb al-Īmān wa-sharā'iʿhā (vol. 6, pp. 527-539)
